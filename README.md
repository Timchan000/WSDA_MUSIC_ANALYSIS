Challenges

The situation: For a long time, Adams Andrew, Manager of WSDA Music, has been unable to
account for a discrepancy in his company’s financials.
The furthest he has gotten in his own attempts to analyze the company data is figuring out that
the discrepancy occurred between the years 2011 and 2012. But that’s about all that Adams
knows for certain.
